## About the Video Course
With the major version release of Unreal Engine 4, Epic games have marked their presence into the world of Virtual Reality. Following the release of some popular product launch such as Oculus, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear and more, VR has gained a lot of grounds and is a booming industry today.
This course would start by teaching you how to work with the VR editor, understand the interaction models, and enhance the experience of your user by scaling the motion controller. We will start by building the game engine from source and launch the latest version of VR Editor then would get into world navigation and understand the menuâ€™s within the editor. Moving on, we will look at setup of camera functionality and motion controllers to create a Toggled and Auto-walk character movement while exploring locomotion movement and teleporting. In the end, we would interact with the environment created by us using Motion Controller interaction.
